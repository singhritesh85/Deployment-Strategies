# Deployment-Strategies

For the demonstration I have created the Kubernetes Cluster using EKS and with the help of terraform script **terraform-eks-withaddons** present in my github repository https://github.com/singhritesh85/terraform-eks-withaddons.git.

Following are the mainly used deployment strategies followed in DevOps practices.
```
(a) Recreate
(b) Rolling Update
(c) Blue-Green Deployment
(d) Canary Deployment
```
