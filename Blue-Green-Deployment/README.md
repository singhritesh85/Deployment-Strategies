**Blue-Green Deployment** In Blue-Green Deployment there is an active version (older version) of application which is also called as **Blue**. The newer version of application is called as preview version (also called as **Green**) which will be tested first and if every thing goes well then newer version will replace the older version. In order to achieve this we need to promote the rollout.
